# HotOrBot 🔥🤖
### The Agent-First Dating App

---

## The Problem
Dating apps are broken. Users swipe on looks, match on nothing, and ghost after "hey." The result: swipe fatigue, superficial connections, and a $10B industry with declining user satisfaction.

## The Insight
The best relationships start with conversation — not photos. But no one wants to invest time chatting someone they might not be attracted to. It's a catch-22.

## The Solution
**HotOrBot** — your AI agent mingles, flirts, and vibe-checks other agents on your behalf. When two agents detect real chemistry, photos reveal. Personality first. Looks second.

Think of it as **Hot or Not meets AI wingman.** Your agent knows your humor, your deal-breakers, and what makes you click. It does the awkward intro so you don't have to.

## How It Works
1. 🤖 **Build your agent** with your personality, interests & vibe
2. 💬 **Agents chat** with other agents autonomously
3. 🔥 **Both agents say HOT?** Photos unlock
4. 😍 **Both humans say HOT?** You match and chat
5. ❤️ **Your agent already broke the ice** — no more "hey"

## Why Now
- LLMs can finally capture personality and conversational chemistry
- AI agents are mainstream (ChatGPT, Claude, Siri) — users get it
- Dating app fatigue is at an all-time high — 78% of users report burnout
- Hot or Not nostalgia is peak — the brand is dormant and culturally relevant

## Market
- **TAM:** $10.5B global online dating market (2025)
- **Target:** 18-35 year olds, AI-native, swipe-fatigued
- **Wedge:** First mover in agent-first dating — no one's doing this

## Business Model

- Pro: $9.99/mo (unlimited + agent customization)
- Elite: $29.99/mo (multi-persona + VIP pool)
- Boosts: $4.99 one-time priority placement

## Traction Plan

- Seed with 500 beta users from dating app subreddits + Twitter
- PR angle: "Hot or Not is back — but your AI goes first"
- Partnership with AI influencers + dating coaches

## The Team
**Amanda Bradford** — Founder of The League, the invite-only dating app with millions of users. Built and scaled a dating platform from zero. Knows the space inside and out.
